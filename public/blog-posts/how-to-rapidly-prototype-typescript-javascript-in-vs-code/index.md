Visual Studio Code is one of the most popular code editors for writing Typescript and Javascript. I use VS Code for all my Typescript and Javascript projects.

If you are like me, using VS Code for writing Typescript / Javascript, you know that sometimes quick prototyping or testing is needed. For this kind of situations I use this extension called Quokka.js.

After installing the extension you can launch a new Typescript / Javascript file with live code execution and results, value explorer, live code coverage and much more. Or if you want to check your existing code, you can also start the extension for an existing file.

I made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnTy4IIa2hE) introducing the extension more throughly so go watch that if you want to learn more! Or if you just want to give it a try, you can install the extension from here: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode).

What do you think about the extension? Let me know in the comments!
