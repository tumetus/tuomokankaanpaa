_This article was originally published on [my newsletter](/newsletter) last week. I publish previous week's newsletter here on the blog. If you want to read these as soon as they are published, [sign up](/newsletter) for the newsletter!_

Ahoy,

If last email was a bit long, this one will be a shorter one.

I didn't upload any videos last week because since the week before was so hectic with Next.js conf and uploading three different videos on [the channel](https://www.youtube.com/tuomokankaanpaa), I felt like taking a bit time off from making videos was sufficient.

I wasn't sitting on my hands though! I was working on planning my next couple of videos. One of which will be the next part of my Next.js Crash Course.

## Next.js Crash Course

If you didn't know, I have a Next.js Crash Course on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/tuomokankaanpaa). I was contemplating on making the course a [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/r/user/tume) course, but decided to make it free and available on Youtube. You can find the course from [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxCkFZQohykkReLJlYsrAoMFjB1b2w7CT).

The course is "work in progress" because instead of making the full course and then publishing it, I decided to publish the videos one by one. That said, I don't have all the videos made yet, so if there is something you would like me to cover, let me know by replying to this email!

## Wrapping up

As I said, this week's email was a shorter one. I want to respect your time and I don't want to make the email a longer one just for the sake of it. Hope you have a great rest of the week!

That's all for this week!

Cheers,
Tuomo
