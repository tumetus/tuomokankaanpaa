Ahoy,

It has been a while since my last email. The reason for why I haven't been sending many emails lately is, that I have been concentrating on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34UXFLKqdW3cpk5CBu2Siw).

But I miss writing these emails to you. So I am going to be more active in sending these emails going forward!

The past week I worked on setting up a new Javascript project that uses a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) structure. In the process I learned about [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) (a tool for managing Javascript projects with multiple packages) and how to setup multiple packages using React & Typescript and how to share code between those packages.

I [uploaded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQUpNa1hZIA) about the process, so if you are interested you can check it out on my channel.

While not working on videos or code, I have just been watching series from Netflix. I am currently watching SEAL team. I pretty much have watched a whole season in the past week, luckily there is still couple of seasons left.

That's it for this week!

Cheers,
Tuomo
