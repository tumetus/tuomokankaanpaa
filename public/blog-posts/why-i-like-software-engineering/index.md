Ahoy,

I have been working as a software engineer over eight years now. This week I stopped to think about all the good things and benefits there is in being a software engineer.

Few of the best things in my opinion are the flexibility and creativity of the work as well as job security. I made a video explaining my thoughts on these in more detail, so if you want to hear more you can find the video on my [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/tuomokankaanpaa).

I read a bunch of blog posts this week. Here is couple of them that I found interesting and useful:

[JavaScript vs JavaScript. Fight! (part 1)](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/javascript-vs-javascript-fight-53fa)

[JavaScript vs JavaScript. Fight! (part 2)](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/javascript-vs-javascript-round-2-fight-2m44)

[The Complete JavaScript Promise Guide](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2021-09/javascript-promises/)

[Top 10 Future Technologies Youâ€™ve Definitely Never Heard Of](https://cult.honeypot.io/reads/10-future-technologies-you-dont-know/)

Last week I told you I was thinking of getting a Kindle. Well this week I finally decided to get it and so far I have really loved it.

I actually read one book in the first day of getting the Kindle. Ok to be honest the book was only 100 pages but still, that is 99 pages more that I read in the past month!

I'm interested to see if I can build up and keep my reading habit more easily by using Kindle.

That's it for this week!

Cheers,
Tuomo
