As a web developer I am able to work remotely quite a lot. Most of the time I'm working from home, but if I'm not at the office, I try to change the environment I work in as much as I can.

Week ago we me and couple of my friends decided to take a remote work day together and head up to my friend's cottage. The plan was to work during the day and then enjoy the finnish summer at the evening and next day.

I created a video about the trip and on the video I share my top 5 tips for remote work. Tips that have helped me to be more efficient and productive when working remotely. You can [watch the video in Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iODfHVTVECQ) or below.

If you rather like to read than watch the video, here are the five tips that I share on the video.

## 1. Take advantage of your job

Take advantage of the fact that if you got a chance to work remotely, do so! And donâ€™t settle to just working from home. If you have chance to go some "exotic" place, go! Or just to the nearest coffee shop, go! The main thing is to change the environment you work in, since it is possible.

## 2. Wake up early

When working remotely, it is so easy to sleep in and wake up quite late. But there are less distractions in the morning and thus you can concentrate better to your work since you are not interrupted by friends / family / phone calls / messages.

I have also noticed that, at least for me, the mornings are the most productive time and it is the best time to work and tackle especially the most difficult task of the day.

## 3. Plan your day

I find it important to plan my day when working remotely or from home. When you go to the office, it is clear when you are working and when you are on your free time. But when you work remotely, the line between work and free time can be quite vague. That's why I like to write a list of tasks, in the previous evening, that I want to complete the next day. This way when I have finished all of the tasks, I can with good conscious quit working for the day.

## 4. Invest in noise cancelling headphones

Yes, it is an investment! If you don't know what [noise cancelling headphones](/blog/noise-cancelling-headphones-should-you-buy-them/) are, they use this technique that cancels noises coming around you making it so that you just hear what is coming out of your headphones. This is so important when you work in a noisy place and want to concentrate only on your work.

I got my first noise cancelling headphones about four years ago and I have never looked back! I won't be buying any other headphones than noise cancelling headphones in the future.

## 5. Take breaks

Even though you are not in the office and you don't have your colleagues to hand out and chat with, you should remember to take breaks. Get away from your computer and go e.g. for a walk for 15 minutes.

Working 8 hours straight is not good for you and you will most definately be more productive and get more done when you take regular breaks rather than sit and work 8 hours straight.
