This post is a short one but I just wanted to drop this post and let you know that **I have started my own web development YouTube channel** and you should [check it out](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34UXFLKqdW3cpk5CBu2Siw)!

I have been writing blog posts to my blog [codepulse.blog](https://codepulse.blog) for over two years now. In that time I have written many posts and tutorials about things related to modern web development.

I have really enjoyed the fact that I can take my years of experience about web development and use it to help others learn web development faster and easier. I hope I can now do the same with videos also and that's why I decided to start my web development [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34UXFLKqdW3cpk5CBu2Siw).

The channel is web development YouTube channel, so I upload videos and tutorials mostly about the same things I have been blogging; things related to web development. For beginners and also more advanced web developers too.

So I encourage you to [check the channel out](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34UXFLKqdW3cpk5CBu2Siw)! And if you are a web developer or interested in web development, whether you are a beginner or pro, definitely [subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34UXFLKqdW3cpk5CBu2Siw?sub_confirmation=1) so you stay up to date on the new content since I upload new content regularly.

Here is couple of the videos I already uploaded on the channel!
