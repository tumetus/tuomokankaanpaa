Ahoy,

I use Visual Studio Code as my main code editor. To be honest it is pretty much the only editor I use. There is bunch of great features in VS Code that I use daily. Features that honestly make my life a lot easier and productive.

So I thought that it might be helpful to share those features in case you are not yet using them or leveraging them fully in your own workflow. You can find the features from the latest video on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/tuomokankaanpaa).

## What I learned this week?

I worked on a Next.js project where I decided to use [Material UI](https://mui.com/) as a component library. At first it was kind of hard to know and find what components I should use but after a while, I got actually something good looking on the screen.

The project is actually a simple Next.js blog application. I plan on shooting a video about it, teaching how to code one by yourself. I'm not yet sure when I'll be making that video but it might be in the near future so [stay tuned for that](https://www.youtube.com/tuomokankaanpaa?sub_confirmation=1)!

I have used Material UI for the past couple of weeks on couple of projects in addition to the Next.js blog application. I am quite excited about Material UI, now that I have a bit better understanding on how the whole thing works and what kind of components should I use for certain situations and what kind of components they actually have!

I have some time now thought that I need to learn something that I can use to make my apps and UIs look even half decent (I am terrible at designing and styling in general). So I was thinking of learning TailwindCSS next but now that I have worked with Material UI a bit, I'm thinking of giving Material UI a chance and learning that first. Of course they are not / don't do "the same thing" but Material UI serves the need that I have and there is only so much one can be learning simultaneously.

Have you used Material UI or TailwindCSS? If you have, let me know what you think about them!

That's it for this week!

Cheers,
Tuomo
