Ahoy,

So [Github Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) was announced couple of weeks ago. I got into the waiting list as soon as it was announced and just the other week I finally got in.

I started to use it right away and after one week of using it I found some problems I kept running with it but also quite a few benefits that using it has.

I ended up making a video where I explain my thoughts on it. You can watch the video on my [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/tuomokankaanpaa).

On the non-coding front, last week I mentioned that I was watching SEAL team on Netflix. Well, just yesterday I finished the last season so right now I am not watching anything.

I am actually glad that I'm not in the middle of binge watching any series, because I really want to concentrate more on reading.

I have always liked physical books but recently I have been leaning towards on buying a [Kindle](https://amzn.to/38X2GIJ). I think it would make me read more, when I don't have to carry a book around and it would be more effortless to read with Kindle than from physical books.

So we'll see if I end up buying one, but until that, I will be reading the physical books I have in my book shelf that have been waiting to be read for too long. I am going to start by reading Kevin Mitnick's [Ghost in the Wires](https://amzn.to/3yYLH3k). It has been sitting on my shelf for too long.

If you have any good book recommendations or if you have experience using Kindle, just hit reply on this email. I would love to hear from you!

That's all for this week!

Cheers,
Tuomo
