Are you using JavaScript and maybe even JavaScript arrow functions but you are not quite sure what they are or how they work or what is the difference between arrow and normal functions.

Well I just uploaded a video to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34UXFLKqdW3cpk5CBu2Siw) where I teach how you can use arrow functions, how they work, how JavaScript "this" works with them and what is the difference between them and normal functions.

You can watch the video below or from [this link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEGfUc2SHqY)
