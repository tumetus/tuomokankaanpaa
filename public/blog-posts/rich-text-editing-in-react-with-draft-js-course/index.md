I am excited to announce that the course "Rich text editing in React with Draft.js" is now LIVE! It is an online course that I created. It is something that I have been working on quite a bit lately. The course is basics course for Draft.js so if you are not yet familiar with the basics of Draft.js, this course is for you!

Few of the topics that the course covers are

- How to add rich text editor component to your React application
- How to add features like bold and underline to the editor
- How to save rich text content to database
- How to load rich text content from database
- How to edit saved content
- How to display saved rich text content e.g. as HTML

There is two ways you can get the course: [Skillshare](https://skl.sh/2WhSXc2) and [Udemy](http://bit.ly/2Z9iOzS).

## Get it on Skillshare (FREE)

Skillshare is an online learning community with thousands of classes covering dozens of different topics. Premium membership gives you unlimited access to high quality classes from experts working their fields to help you learn new skills.

You need a premium membership, priced at $14 / month, to take classes. Good news is that right now (not sure how much longer) they have this promotion going on where you get **2 months of premium membership for free** when you register through [this link](https://skl.sh/2WhSXc2). Yes you read right. You can take my course (and any other course on the platform) for free!

## Get it on Udemy ($9.99)

Udemy is a little different than Skillshare. It is also an online learning platform but it sells courses for fixed price rather than for a monthly subscription. My course "Rich text editing in React with Draft.js" is going for $24.99 but I decided to give Codepulse readers a hefty discount and first 100 people who enroll for the course will get it on a -60% discount for $9.99. You can get the discounted price by using code CODEPULSE or clicking [this link](http://bit.ly/2Z9iOzS).

This course is something I have planned to do for a long time and I am super happy that it is now finished and available for everyone to take! If you take the course, either on Skillshare or Udemy, first of all I want to say thank you, I really do appreciate it! But also please leave a review or otherwise let me know what you thought of the course, it will help me develop the course for better.
