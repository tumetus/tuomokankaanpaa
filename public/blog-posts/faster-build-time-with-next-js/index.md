title: "Want FASTER build time with Next.js? DO THIS! âš¡"
excerpt: "Next.js Incremental Static Regeneration enables you to add dynamic data to static pages. With Next.js ISR you can also use static generation on demand for the pages you want. This results in much faster builds because you don't have to build all of the pages of your Next.js application in build time."

Ahoy,

In my last email I mentioned that I was planning on still making one or two Next.js videos this year. Last week I published one of those.

The video is about reducing your Next.js application build time with Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).

This Next.js feature is super cool since it allows you, among other things, to render dynamic content on static pages!

I also published another video about how you can use GIT branches to easily test different features or make a demo of a new feature. If your GIT-game is not in a good shape, this video is great refresher / tutorial for you!
