I’m excited to announce that I just published my new online course "React for Beginners: Complete Guide to Mastering React Fundamentals" on [Skillshare](https://skl.sh/2XAKn7u)!

I have received by far the most requests to create a React fundamentals course, and I’m super happy that I can finally share it with you!

On the course I will teach, as the name suggests, the very fundamentals of React.

Here are some of the topics we will cover on the course:

- React Elements & Components
- Working with JSX
- Using data with Props
- State
- How to create stateless & stateful components
- Building your first application

If you know JavaScript but you are not yet familiar with React or maybe you have at some point tried to learn React but never really got the hang of it, well in that case this course is a must watch for you!

You can find it from [Skillshare](https://skl.sh/2XAKn7u). Best part is that you can get it for free! When you register to Skillshare through [this link](https://skl.sh/2XAKn7u), you get 2 months of Skillshare premium membership for free. You can cancel your membership anytime, so there is no obligations.

With the Skillshare premium membership you can watch my courses and every other course they have (there is like tens of thousands of them) for the next 2 months. So it's really a no-brainer.

If React is something you want to learn, I strongly recommend you check the course out! I would also really appreciate if you let me know what you think of it!

_If you are already familiar with React, you might be interested on my [Draft.js course](/blog/rich-text-editing-in-react-with-draft-js-course/). Draft.js is a rich text editor framework for React. If you need editor or text input component that can handle rich text content, Draft.js is a great choice. Like React, it is also originally created by Facebook._
